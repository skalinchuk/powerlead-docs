title: API Limits
description: ""
---

To ensure a stable and fair experience for all users, the Powerlead Public API enforces a set of usage limits and processing constraints. These safeguards help us deliver fast, reliable enrichment across thousands of concurrent users.

---

### Request Limits

- **Maximum Items per Request:** `1000`
  Each request to the Bulk Enrichment API can contain up to 1000 items. If your dataset is larger, please split it into multiple requests.

- **Maximum Requests per Second:** `5`
  To prevent overload and ensure performance consistency, we limit each API key to 5 requests per second.

Exceeding these limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` error. We recommend implementing exponential backoff or a queuing mechanism in your integration to handle retries gracefully.

---

### Processing Behavior

- **Batch Size:** `50 items per batch`
  All records are processed internally in batches of 50.

- **Processing Order:** `Sequential (consecutive)`
  Each batch is processed in the order it was received. This ensures predictable behavior and easier debugging in case of data issues.

### Pro Tips

- If you're enriching a large number of items, consider splitting it into chunks of up to 1000 records and submitting them in a staggered manner to avoid hitting validation limits.
- Monitor your job statuses and schedule retries only when needed — avoid retrying completed or still-processing jobs.
- Use the `/status/{job_id}` endpoint to track progress and wait for completion before calling `/result/{job_id}`.
