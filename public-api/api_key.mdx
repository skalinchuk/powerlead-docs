Powerlead’s Public API is designed to give you powerful, programmatic access to our industry-leading enrichment services. Built on REST principles, it provides a simple and consistent interface for submitting, tracking, and retrieving enrichment tasks at scale. Whether you're enriching thousands of records or just a handful, our API is built to be fast, reliable, and easy to integrate into your existing workflows or automation pipelines.

If you have an active subscription to [Powerlead.com](https://powerlead.com), you can generate your personal API key directly from the Account section of your dashboard at [dashboard.powerlead.com](https://dashboard.powerlead.com/). This API key grants secure access to the Bulk Enrichment API and is required to authenticate your requests. With this token, you'll be able to submit bulk jobs, monitor progress, retrieve results, and track your usage — all through a seamless developer-friendly interface.

Our Public API Base URL is: `https://api.powerlead.com`
